# Welcome to the new portfolio

Thanks for stopping by! This relaunch simplifies the stack and tightens up performance, accessibility, and security while keeping the playful visuals.

## Whatâ€™s new

- Leaner data flow (cards load from a small JSON; content loads from Markdown)
- Safer rendering via sanitization and link hardening
- Smoother transitions between views

## Quick code sample

```js
// A tiny helper used throughout the site
export function wait(ms) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
```

## A tiny bit of math

We sometimes write inline formulas like $E = mc^2$ and display blocks:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}\,dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
